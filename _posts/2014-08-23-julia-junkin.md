page-introduction: Julia’s an artist who will forever doodle. But there’s more here. As she moves easily between French poster art and Indian religious murals, we suspect a genre-bending belief–a key tenet of JUJU.

**1-Where do you find inspiration?**
little beautiful things, handmade things...funny things, funny people. When people are impassioned and alive it is almost always inspiring to me; that could be anything from a performance to someone earnestly expressing themselves...I'd say life is pretty inspiring!

**2-What’s your preferred medium for making art?**
I am a major doodler...so give me pens paper...and i am super happy. Also acrylics and wood i love that combo.

**3-What are the tools you love to work with?**
pens and pencils.. black sharpies and nice black pens...they are very exciting....

**4-Talk to us about the process of creating on JUJU…**
Well.....I really pulled from my main themes...women and little still life things (cups, forks, a branch etc) I think almost anything works on juju an involved piece of art or a simple drawing. For instance even a little drawing of a branch duplicated over and over starts to look really cool on juju. (love the duplicate feature)

**5-Before joining JUJU, was collaboration with other artists an important part of your process?**
Yes! Collaboration is my favorite because something entirely new is created that I would not have thought of when you work with someone else.....thats why I love juju...You get to collaborate and create your own unique creation yet you’re using other people’s artwork... I love that. Possibilities are endless.

**6-What scares you about creativity?**
Basically I totally love creativity...and the chaos process...that ultimately leads to the birth of something brand new. But I guess what i never quite get used to is in the middle of the process...there are inevitably these moments when you are not quite sure you are going to make it......right then I tend to get shakey for a day or so and then thank god I get my head together and realize the only way through is to keep going...and I give it what I have got, It usually turns out alright! What I have learned is everyone is unsure at times...you just got to go for it. Life is short...don’t fool yourself.

**7-How has your creative process changed over time? How has technology impacted you?**
my creative process is similar...yet i collaborate with people more now which is fun. Technology has not impacted my actual initial production of artwork but I have used it quite a bit in the collaboration process..

**8-Last chance, anything else you think we should know?**
well I am one of the founders of JUJU you should probably know that! My initial inspiration for JUJU was: can we create something that is inspiring ,creative and fun to use....and that people can remember that they are naturally creative....given the right opportunity! Thanks.
