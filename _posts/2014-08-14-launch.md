New App for Messaging Via Art Hits App Store June 2014
New Bend, Oregon tech company creates iOS 7 app where a picture is worth a thousand words

Bend, Oregon, June 23, 2014—Good JUJU, a new Bend company bringing together technology and art, today announced the launch of its new iOS 7 Creative App in the Apple Store this month. The new app, called JUJU, is a creative platform that gives users a fun, new, art-based visual language for expressing themselves when words just don’t do the trick.

“In today’s technology-driven world, it’s easy to lose sight of things like creativity and art,” said JUJU Founder and Visual Artist, Julia Junkin. “This app brings the two worlds together in a very approachable, accessible way that everyone–from the creatives to those who don’t think of themselves as creative–can all play with and make something cool.”

As an incubator of creativity through visual art, JUJU enables users to pull art samples from portfolios of fine artists and combine them into sharable works of art. For example, if a user would like to text “Happy Birthday” or “Good Night” then he or she uses JUJU to visually remix artists’ works to send art via text as an image.

JUJU can be downloaded on iPhones for free in the Apple Store, allowing users to collect packs with a curated library of artists’ works. While JUJU is a creative outlet for its users, JUJU is also a tool that supports artists from around the world.

Local artists from JUJU’s headquarters in Bend, Oregon include photographers, illustrators, typographers, graphic designers and painters. Those featured in JUJU’s launch library include Bend’s own Dan Parsons, Adam Hayes, Alex Reisfar, Kelly Fleming, Mona Daly, Brian Daly, Tyler Roemer, Benjamin Kinzer, Natalie Puls, Tom Carson and JUJU co-owner, Julia Junkin––as well as many other talented visual artists from around the nation.

For additional information or to become a contributing JUJU artist, contact Jacqueline Smith by phone (541-639-7728) or email at jacq(at)sharethejuju(dot)com. Visit their website for more information at sharethejuju.com or download JUJU in the iTunes Store.
