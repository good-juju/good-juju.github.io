**1-Where do you find inspiration?**
In the mountains. When I have no idea what’s going to happen next. 

**2-What’s your preferred medium for making art?**
It’s more heavy towards digital now––but I do prefer Polaroids. They slow me down because I have to take more time and care. 

**3-What are the tools you love to work with?**
I like my Mamiya Medium Format Polaroid, Lightroom, Canon, iMac. 

**4-Before joining JUJU, was collaboration with other artists an important part of your process?**
Absolutely. Video guys and even the athletes themselves.

**7-How has your creative process changed over time? How has technology impacted you?**
It’s always changing––changing my style constantly, slowly. Technology encourages innovation.
