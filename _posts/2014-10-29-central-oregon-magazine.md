JUJU<br>
Art Mashup App<br>

A Bend artistic technology upstart puts the juju in artistic mashup. When a path to communication doesn't exist, sometimes the best policy is to invent it from scratch. At least that's what local entrepreneurs Jacqueline Smith and Julia Junkin did. They created a breakthrough creative app called JUJU that combines technology with beauty, allowing users to mashup artistic images and their own message in a user-friendly, interactive format. 

The two Bend women conceived the idea while throwing around ideas at a restaurant one day, and expanded the into reality. Launched earlier this year and available for free download in the Apple Store, the app is easy to use. It comes with a catalogue of digital art that users mix and match, like a collage, and then write over of they wish, creating their own text message, emails, digital postcards, wallpaper or greeting cards. The mashups are called JUJUs.

Hundreds of thousands of contributors, many from local artists, make up the catalogue, depicting images of everything from the San Francisco Bridge to a Pegasus. As the company continues to grow, Junkin hopes users will utilize JUJUs as an innovative means of communicating. “It’s using a language that’s universal,” she expounds. “It’s a beautiful place for creativity.” 

While the makers of the app grow familiar with copyright laws, they also hope to market JUJU on an international platform, starting with nearby English-speaking countries and then moving further. But as the app expands its reach, Smith expects the roots to stay local. “Bend it literally brimming with talent,” she says.
