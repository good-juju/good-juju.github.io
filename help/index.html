<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>How can I apply to be a JUJU artist?</p>

<blockquote><p>Email us at hello@sharethejuju.com</p></blockquote>

<p>Help! JUJU froze and isn&rsquo;t responding! What do I do?</p>

<blockquote><p>First, try to force quit JUJU</p></blockquote>

<p>My In App Purchases (packages) are missing or not available?</p>

<blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t worry! We keep track of what you&rsquo;ve bought so you can never lose
your purchases in JUJU. Try swiping to the left from the main screen
and tapping the menu button in the upper right corner. You&rsquo;ll see a
button that says &ldquo;Restore purchases&rdquo;. Tap that button and you should get
all your purchased art back. If that doesn&rsquo;t work drop us a line at
help@sharethejuju.com and we&rsquo;ll get it sorted for you.</p></blockquote>
