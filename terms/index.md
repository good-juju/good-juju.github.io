#TERMS & CONDITIONS

Thank you for your interest in the JuJu software application and any related website (collectively “JUJU”).  We hope you find JUJU useful and fun!  Please review the below carefully, and agree to these terms, before moving forward.

####TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE OF JUJU AND FEATURED ILLUSTRATIONS, PHOTOGRAPHS AND OTHER IMAGES

The following is a legal agreement between you and Good JuJu, LLC.  The terms “we,” “us,” and “Good JuJu” used within this agreement includes Good JuJu, LLC, and when applicable, its affiliates, content providers, successors, licensors, licensees, resellers, and their respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, partners and agents.  Before accessing the illustrations, photos, images and other artwork herein (COLLECTIVELY, “Artwork”), YOU MUST AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Your Binding Agreement.  By accessing, using, viewing, purchasing, downloading or capturing any Artwork from JUJU, you agree to all of these terms and conditions.  If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, do not view, access, or otherwise use JUJU or any Artwork.

2. Unauthorized Use/Your Responsibilities.  Good JuJu’s business depends on the enforcement of its licenses and the payment of fees for use of the Artwork, so the unauthorized use of Artwork seriously jeopardizes the ability of Good JuJu to provide JUJU.
	(a). Liquidated Damages.  All licenses for use of the Artwork and JUJU include certain restrictions, including restrictions as to duration and manner of use.  Should the scope of your use exceed those limitations, you may be billed as follows:
	In addition to any and all fees, damages and penalties Good JuJu may be entitled to under this Agreement and applicable law , you hereby agree to pay 10 times the standard Good JuJu license fee based on your actual use of any and all unauthorized uses of Artwork, a 10% royalty on gross retail sales revenue for unauthorized use of Artwork on products for sale, and a 50% royalty on gross sales related to unauthorized sub-licensing or any other unauthorized redistribution of the Artwork; you also agree to pay Good JuJu’s attorney fees accrued in resolving the matter of your unauthorized use; and you agree to injunctive relief in respect to any unauthorized use.
	You acknowledge and agree that the above fees are a reasonable approximation of the expense and diligence required by Good JuJu in monitoring and policing unauthorized uses of the Artwork and JUJU and partially accounts for the detriment to the commercial value of the Artwork based on such unauthorized usage, although such detriment cannot truly be compensated by monetary amounts.

3.  Copyright Ownership/Derivative Works.
	(a). Ownership.  JUJU, the underlying code and the Artwork include a large number of creative works and specific images which are protected as individual works and proprietary compilations under copyright law.   Good JuJu and/or its licensors retain all right, title, and interest in and to all such copyrights, patent rights, trademarks, and all other proprietary rights reflected in JUJU and the Artwork.
	(b.) Your Obligations with Respect to  Copyrights.  You don’t acquire any copyright ownership in any images from the Artwork based on any right, title or interest which may arise in a compilation or derivative work you create using JUJU.  You grant Good JuJu the perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free right to use any compilation or derivative work you create using JUJU.
	
4.  Use of JUJU/Licensed Artwork. 
	(a). License.  Only you are permitted to use Artwork you license.  Any license granted to you by Good JuJu is limited, non-transferable and non-sublicensable, unless otherwise specified in writing.  You are jointly and severally liable for any breach of any license terms by third parties who may secure or obtain the licensed Artwork from you.

	(b). Derivative Works.  You acknowledge and agree that the Artwork may be used to create new artwork for the purposes of JUJU, but it may not be used as reference or as a basis to create a different individual image for independent exploitation.  You agree not to provide to an independent illustrator, photographer, or other person any Artwork to use as reference or for the style or approach to create a new image.

	(c). Offending Uses Prohibited.  Artwork may not be used for any pornographic uses, for unlawful purposes, in a manner which reflects poorly on Good JuJu, in a manner that is offensive or in poor taste in Good JuJu’s sole discretion, or in violation of any privacy, publicity, moral rights, copyright, or trademark rights.

	(d). JUJU Software.  You agree not to reverse-engineer, re-create or otherwise decompile the JUJU code for any reason, or interfere with the operation of JUJU in any manner.

5. Releases/Clearance of Content Are Your Responsibility.
	(a). Clearing Third Party Rights.  The Artwork contains very few images which utilize subject matter such as buildings, individuals, property or other content that could possibly involve the proprietary rights of others, but some images may be subject to copyrights, trademarks, rights of publicity, rights of privacy, rights of affiliation, moral rights or other rights.  The use of such images is at your sole risk and liability, and you are solely responsible for determining whether your use of any such images requires a release or waiver.
	(b). Errors/Subjectively Offensive Content.  Some information on JUJU may contain technical or other mistakes, factual or legal inaccuracies, typographical errors, or be incomplete or out-of-date. Additionally, JUJU and its content (including images) may include images and text that you, your clients or consumers may find inappropriate or potentially offensive. You are solely responsible for determining whether any content is accurate, current, or complete, or whether the use of such information may be offensive.

6.  Your Account.  You agree that your use of JUJU is a privilege which allows you to access, utilize and otherwise enjoy JUJU.  You agree your password and any other information necessary to access JUJU will be kept secret and confidential. You shall not disclose such information to any other party without the express written permission of Good JuJu. You further agree that you will be responsible for all access or use of JUJU which occurs through your account, and that use of your account information and password to access JUJU constitutes conclusive evidence that you are responsible for the access and utilization of any Artwork.  If you suspect someone is making unauthorized uses of your account, contact Good JuJu immediately.

7. Termination of Account and Service.  You agree that Good JuJu, in its sole discretion, may terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of JUJU and Artwork, at any time for any reason or no reason without any liability to you.  In such case, your only recourse is to immediately discontinue your use of JUJU. 

8.  Limitation of Liability.  
	(a) Use JUJU at Your Own Risk.  JUJU AND THE ASSOCIATED INFORMATION, SERVICES, PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS, ARTWORK AND MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS.  YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT USE OF JUJU, INCLUDING ALL ASSOCIATED CONTENT, ARTWORK, DATA OR SOFTWARE, IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. 

	(b) JUJU Damages.  YOU AGREE THAT GOOD JUJU SHALL HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES, COSTS OR LOSSES SUFFERED BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH JUJU OR ANY ARTWORK OR CONTENT CONTAINED THEREIN, UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR BUSINESS, YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM INTERACTION WITH JUJU OR DOWNLOAD OF RELATED ARTWORK, DATA AND/OR SOFTWARE. 

	(c)  Good JuJu Liability to You.  GOOD JUJU’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR ENTIRE REMEDY FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSS YOU MAY SUFFER FROM ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO GOOD JUJU FOR THE ARTWORK AT ISSUE.   

9.  Your Indemnification of Good JuJu.  You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Good JuJu harmless  against all claims (including claims by third parties), liability, damages, judgments, settlements, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses), arising out of or relating to: (a) your breach or alleged breach of any terms, conditions or restrictions of this Agreement; (b) your use or modification of JUJU or any Artwork; (c) your failure to secure any permission needed from third parties to use the Artwork; and (d) any act or failure to act by you or any of your employees, contractors, employers, agents or other affiliates.

10. One-Year Period to File Cause of Action.  Any cause of action you may have with respect to your use of JUJU must be commenced within one (1) year after the events from which the cause of action arises occurs.  For example, any claim arising from your use of Artwork must commence within one year of your first download of that Artwork. 

11. Modification/Termination.   Good JuJu reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change, modify, add/or remove any portion of this Agreement or the JUJU services features, in whole or in part, at any time, including Artwork availability and pricing.
